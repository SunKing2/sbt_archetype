sbt_archetype:
  Creates sbt directories for typical scala project.
  It creates empty directories for Java too.

It creates all directories in  
  test
  src
  
It uses
  com.example

It creates a 
  Hello 
  Short test example for scalatest.

You'll like it, I promise.

$ git clone git@github.com:SunKing2/sbt_archetype.git
$ cd sbt_archetype
$ sbt compile
$ sbt test
$ sbt run
Now rename the sbt_archetype directory to your project's name.

Don't do this unless you know what you are doing:
(there's a lame bash script called sbtdirs that COULD rebuild some of this:)
$ chmod +x sbtdirs
$ sbtdirs
